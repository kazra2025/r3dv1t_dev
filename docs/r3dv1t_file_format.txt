This is r3dv1t file format. Its not versioned as of now, and is unlikely to need changes.
The plan is to accommodate future changes inside meta_dict and chunk system.

- A r3dv1t file represents the encrypted vault or archive. its an object store.
- objects are hashed to compute obj_ids to track them.
- object fingerprinting is done using hmac_sha3_384 the vks.osfp_key (derived from userpass, see kdf)
- r3dv1t file is a psv text file where each line represents a frame.
- lines maybe of any length, but for optimal performance chunk size of 2k or 4k are recommended.


# ------------------------------------------ line spec
[meta_dict_b64] | [encrypted frame payload or ct_chunk_b64]


- meta_dict_b64: urlsafe_b64 encoded json dict -- this is where all the extensibility is.
- ct_chunk_b64:  urlsafe_b64 encrypted frame payload


Example lines:
eyJpIjogMH0=|__muh_data__|

# ------------------------------------------ frame_hmac

- meta_dict['h'] = frame_hmac
- its sha3_256 hmac of everything in meta_dict using vks.frame_hmac_key
- more specifically:

buffer_part1 = meta_dict -> json (str) -> ascii (bytes)
buffer_part2 = ct_chunk

frame_hmac = hmac_sha3_256(vks.frame_hmac_key, buffer_part1 + buffer_part2 )




# ------------------------------------------ Misc notes
- urlsafe base64 encoding - only 33% space penalty worth it -- 3 bytes becomes 4 bytes
this allows the output file to be a easyily readable text file.
Aaaand git can store the file efficiently with line diffs. As objects are added/removed to/from the vault.

- b64 is always urlsafe variant by default unless otherwise specified.
